# Meeting Cards
Cards for your phone to hold up
when you're on a group video call

This is a virtual card app that contains cards
to aid in video conference calls similar to
[Collaboration Supercards](https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/supercards/).

The project was forked from [Stephen Walkers version](https://github.com/stephenwalker78/meeting-cards)
and completely rewritten as a PWA with no external dependencies.

## Usage
- Open the app and tap on a card. The card will now take up the full screen.
- Hold the phone with its screen facing the camera
so the participants of your call can see the card.
- Tap the fullscreen card to minify it back into the
selection raster.

Please feel very much encouraged to open issues and
